# Model, Data, and Log Files
# =========================
# To ensure .txt, .keras, .joblib, .json, .parquet, .csv files
# (especially your models and processed data) ARE TRACKED,
# make sure there are NO general rules like '*.keras' or 'models_store/'
# that would ignore them.
#
# For example, DO NOT have lines like these if you want to track these files:
# *.keras
# *.joblib
# *.json
# *.txt
# *.parquet
# models_store/
# data/processed/
#
# If you want to ignore specific large data files but track others,
# list the specific large files to ignore, e.g.:
# data/raw/very_large_raw_file.zip
