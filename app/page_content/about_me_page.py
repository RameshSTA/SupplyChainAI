    A highly motivated and analytical professional, holding a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a Specialisation in AI, and currently advancing practical expertise through a Professional Year in IT. My core strength lies in translating complex data into actionable insights and developing end-to-end AI/ML solutions.
    <br><br>
    I possess a robust skill set in Python, SQL, and R, complemented by a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms (including predictive analytics, classification, and deep learning), Natural Language Processing (NLP), statistical methods, and data visualisation techniques. This is further solidified by hands-on internship experience involving data analysis and the application of machine learning models. My project portfolio, particularly "SupplyChainAI" and "E-Commerce Feedback Mining," demonstrates a capacity for independent development and deployment of interactive, data-driven applications using tools like Streamlit.
