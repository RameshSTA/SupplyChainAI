    st.markdown("""
    SupplyChainAI is engineered to directly confront and mitigate pervasive challenges that impede enterprise growth, constrict profitability, and diminish market responsiveness:

    * **Pervasive Demand Uncertainty:** Overcoming the limitations of conventional forecasting in highly volatile environments, thereby minimising the financial and reputational impact of stockouts and excess inventory.
    * **Suboptimal Capital Allocation:** Addressing excessive working capital tied up in inventory, reducing holding costs, and mitigating risks of product obsolescence or spoilage.
    * **Fragmented Operational Visibility & Agility:** Countering the effects of siloed data and reactive decision-making to enhance the capacity for proactive adaptation to unforeseen global disruptions (e.g., geopolitical instability, climatic events, supplier inconsistencies).
    * **Escalating Competitive & Margin Pressures:** Providing crucial optimisation levers for businesses striving to enhance service delivery, reduce operational friction, and protect margins in fiercely competitive arenas.

    By architecting AI-driven solutions to these challenges, SupplyChainAI offers a clear trajectory towards significant and measurable business outcomes:

    * **Enhanced Financial Performance:** Driving profitability through strategic cost containment (inventory, logistics, operations) and revenue protection against stockouts.
    * **Elevated Customer Experience & Brand Loyalty:** Ensuring superior product availability, improving delivery reliability, and fostering more responsive customer engagement.
    * **Optimised Operational Throughput:** Streamlining complex planning cycles, enabling intelligent automation in decision-support, and maximising resource utilisation across the entire value network.
    * **Fortified Risk Management & Business Continuity:** Instilling the foresight to anticipate potential vulnerabilities and the agility to orchestrate effective responses, thereby safeguarding revenue and market standing.
    * **Data-Driven Strategic Superiority:** Converting vast datasets into actionable, predictive intelligence that underpins superior strategic planning and tactical execution, essential for industry leadership.

    This platform provides a practical demonstration of applied AI through the following key, interconnected modules:

    **1. Advanced Demand Forecasting Engine:**
    * In-depth analysis of historical sales data (exemplified using the Walmart Sales dataset) to discern complex trends, seasonality, and causal factors.
    * Rigorous development, training, and comparative evaluation of a diverse portfolio of forecasting methodologies:
        * *Classical Time Series Models:* Naive, Seasonal Naive, ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality), SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Prophet.
        * *Machine Learning Regression Algorithms:* Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
        * *Deep Learning Sequential Models:* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
    * Interactive dashboards facilitating granular forecast exploration, comprehensive model performance assessment (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), and insightful error analysis.

    **2. Intelligent Inventory Strategy & Financial Optimisation:**
    * Algorithmic calculation of critical inventory control parameters: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Safety Stock (SS), and Reorder Point (ROP), tailored to specific business objectives.
    * Dynamic integration of demand forecast distributions (mean and variance) to continuously refine and optimise inventory parameters against target service levels and cost structures.
    * Sophisticated simulation capabilities to project inventory dynamics, service level achievements, and total cost of ownership under diverse operational policies and demand scenarios.
    * Comprehensive sensitivity analysis tools to elucidate the financial and operational impact of variations in key inputs such as holding costs, order costs, lead times, or service level commitments.
