        - **Inaccurate Demand Forecasting:** Leading to stockouts or overstocking, impacting revenue and customer satisfaction.
        - **High Inventory Holding Costs:** Tying up valuable capital and increasing the risk of product obsolescence or spoilage.
        - **Inefficient Supplier Management:** Potentially leading to unreliable supply, inconsistent quality, and suboptimal pricing.
        - **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Difficulty in adapting and responding to unforeseen events (e.g., geopolitical issues, natural disasters, pandemics).

        **1. Demand Forecasting Insights:**
        * Analysis of historical sales data (utilizing a Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset as an example).
        * Development and comparative analysis of various forecasting models:
            * Classical Time Series Methods: Naive, Seasonal Naive, ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality), SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Prophet.
            * Machine Learning Regression Techniques: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
            * Deep Learning Architectures: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
        * Interactive exploration of generated forecasts and detailed model performance metrics.

        **2. Inventory Strategy & Optimization:**
        * Calculation of fundamental inventory parameters: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Safety Stock (SS), and Reorder Point (ROP).
        * Integration of demand forecasts to dynamically inform and adjust inventory parameters.
        * Simulation of different inventory policies to visualize their performance and cost implications.
        * Sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in inventory parameters affect outcomes.

        **(Future Functionalities - Conceptual):**
        * Proactive Supply Chain Risk Detection & Mitigation Planning.
        * Supplier Performance Analytics & Scorecarding.
        * Network Optimization & Logistics Planning.
